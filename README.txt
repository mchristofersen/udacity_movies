To view the webpage, open "entertainment_center.py" and run the file.
A browser window should open showing the newly generated "fresh_tomatoes.html" page.

New movies may be added to the page by creating an instance of Movie() in "entertainment_center.py".

The format is as follows:

{movie_name} = media.Movie(   "{Movie_Name}",
                              "{Plot_Description}",
                              "{Poster_URL}",
                              "{Youtube_Trailer_URL}"
                          )

                            *Important*

"movie_name" must be appended to the list "movie_list" to be rendered on the page.
